            The word Brit means "covenant" and the word Milah means "circumcision".
            Circumcision is that which permanently establishes a covenant between G-d and the Jew. (A Jewish
            female is born already circumcised, so to speak, possessing this holy sign within her from the
            moment of birth.)
        </p>

        <p class="articleIndividualP">
            G-d wanted to permanently affix a symbol on the bodies of the people He chose to be called by His
            name. Circumcision was designated as the symbol of this covenant, being that this is the source from
            which the perpetuation of the species emanates.
